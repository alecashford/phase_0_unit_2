while I like using the command line to push to github, I do not see an altogether
radical improvement to doing so as opposed to using the application. I guess
it is convenient not having to have the app open but there do not seem to be
appreciable funcitonal differences. However, I am confiden that as I delve
deeper into this subject, I will begin to appreciate some of these hidden
advantages.
